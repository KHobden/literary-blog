# About Me  

Hi, welcome to my website. My name is Sophie and I’m an aspiring writer. 

After completing a creative writing course earlier this year, I started this website to begin sharing my writing publicly. 

I have always loved the act of writing and storytelling, with my inspiration being planted and watered through books and films as a child. I’m excited to finally be transferring my countless notebooks of writing to this online space. 

Whilst I’ll be reserving some of my book drafts from here, I will be sharing my writing in its varying forms, including book and film reviews, articles and my own fiction pieces. 

I hope you enjoy reading the content I share and if you would like to share your thoughts on my writing; feel free to comment on my posts or contact me through my Instagram page.
